Task: Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption & Decryption Date: 10-December-2024

*** WELCOME TO PIXEL MANIPULATION FOR IMAGE ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION TECHNIQUE ***

In the image encryption process, we use the Python PIL library. The script prompts the user for the image path and encryption key, verifies them, and opens the image in binary read mode. The image data is converted to a byte array, and a bitwise XOR operation is applied using the encryption key. The encrypted byte array is then saved to the file, and a completion message is displayed. For decryption, the same method is applied with the same key, and the decrypted data is saved, confirming the process is complete.
